# 16 Cycles

Software Engineering Project, Year 2, Semester 2.
Team 16: Jonathan Alderson, Andy Parkes, Ciaran Brennen, Domantas Dilys, Matthew Cumber, Slavyana Chervenkondeva

This is our group project, consisting of a Flask web application and a QT desktop application for staff members.

================================= RUNNING THE APPLICATIONS FOR DEMO MODE =================================
To build and run the *web application* open the terminal and type: 
	$ sh setup.txt 

This will create a virtual environment, install all required flask modules (listed in 'requirements.txt')
so that the project can be built, and then run it.
The website can then be accessed on:
	http://127.0.0.1:8111/ 
to exit, press CTRL+C

after exiting, if the application needs to be relaunched, it can be launched with:
	$ sh webAppLaunch.txt
	so that it does not reinstall flask and its modules


To run the *desktop application* open the terminal and type: 
	$ sh qtlaunch.txt 

the desktop app can be manually launched from;
	/qtapp 16Cycles

This module was teaching us the basics of creating large projects.
This coursework was not really marked based on how good the code was.
But I made a nice Unity phone app and managed to get it deployed.
This was the first thing I deployed and was nice working in PHP
with real servers.

I got 75 on this module. Mostly because it wasn't marked based 
on how good your programming was, but how good your write up was.
